The Micro_aprs / Namo_APRS modem firmware can be uploaded to a Arduino based taget 
using the standard Arduino or the optiboot bootloader.

The .cmd file 2flashAPRS needs to be modified for the actual COM port number the USB UART has enumerated to. 

For the weather station APRS modem use the 5V SimpleSerial image needs to be used. The BAUD rate needs to be 
adjusted depending on the bootloader present on the target.  

Fuses on the target should be set to 9xFD, 0xDA,0xFF beforehand with the help of a debug interface
 programmer when loading the bootloader to an empty chip.
